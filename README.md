# OpenPoliceData
A Python package for police data analysis that provides easy access to incident-level police data for traffic stops, pedestrian stops, arrests, use of force, and other types of interactions.

## Installation
OpenPoliceData is easiest to install with ``conda``. This is particularly true in Windows where the required geopandas package is more difficult to install without conda. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your system if not already available
* Create a folder where you want the code to reside: /path/to/repo
* Open an Anaconda Prompt or terminal and navigate to that folder.
> `cd /path/to/repo/`
* Clone the repo
> `git clone git@github.com:sowdm/openpolicedata.git` OR
> `git clone https://github.com/sowdm/openpolicedata.git`
* Install the dependencies
> ```conda install --file conda/requirements-conda.txt```

> `pip install -r conda/requirements-pip.txt`
* Navigate to openpolicedata folder
> `cd openpolicedata`
