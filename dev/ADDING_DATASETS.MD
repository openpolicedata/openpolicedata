# Guide to Recommending or Adding Datasets
Adding or recommending datasets to be included in OpenPoliceData is a great way to contribute to the project. This guide provides suggestions for how to find open police data, what types of data should be included, how to recommend the dataset to the team (if you are recommending), and how to add the dataset (if you are adding).

## What Data Is Being Tracked or Has Already Been Added?
This spreadsheet (``Add link!!!``) tracks datasets that:
* Have already been added (Added)
* Have been recommended for inclusion but have yet to be added (X)
* Require code updates to add (Code Issue)
* Have been recommended for inclusion but there are reliability or other issues with the download URL or website (URL Issue)

It includes information on:
* Name of the source (typically a police department)
* State
* Open data website URL (if any)
* Date last checked for open data
* User name of who last checked for open data
* What open data sets are avaible including if no data is available
* Comments

## How to Find Datasets?
First of all, where police departments and other sources share their open data can vary so if you're looking for open data for a specific department, be prepared to search a bit. That being said, there are some general guidelines for finding data in most cases.

### Which Departments/Sources to Check
The [Police Data Initiative](https://www.policedatainitiative.org/datasets) is a good place to start. As of the time of writing this document, not all departments that have qualifying open data have been added from this list at this source.

Otherwise, just select any police department that is either not on the spreadsheet or is on the spreadsheet but has not recently been checked. Then, follow the instructions below for finding data on either their site or their municipality's (the county, city, or town) site.

### Searching for a Department/Source's Data
The most common location of police open data is on the municipality's Open Data site. The following steps generally work for this case:
* Internet search for ``{town/county/city name} open data``
