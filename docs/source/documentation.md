# OpenPoliceData

Welcome to the *new* OpenPoliceData documentation. The **OpenPoliceData (OPD)** Python library is the most comprehensive centralized public access point for incident-level police data in the United States. OPD provides easy access to 425+ incident-level datasets for about 4865 police agencies. Types of data include traffic stops, use of force, officer-involved shootings, and complaints. It provides a simple interface for finding publically available data and downloading data into [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames.
